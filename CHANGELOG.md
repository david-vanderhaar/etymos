- v0.0.0
  - The original MVP was don in pure HTML, CSS, and JS. It will live on in a legacy branch for posterity.
- v0.0.1
  - This is the first tracked version. We moved the code from plain JS to Svelte. This will make future changes easier to implement since the app is quite reactive and Svelte is a simple, easy to read framework.
- v0.0.2
  - add Box UI wrapped for quick styling.
  - add basic version of noun editor display (this is where user will interact with words na transform them).
